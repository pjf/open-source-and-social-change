* It's easy not to see injustice in your own community.
* Australia is seeing racial motivated violence... again
* People online get harrassed purely due to the apparent gender of their nick
* Of *course* I'm not seeing that harrassment, it's not targeted at me

* Sometimes I see projects where I'm told "you need to be thick skinned"
* Like somehow it's okay that everyone there is a jerk
* It's not.
* And yet this seems to be the state of so many technology-focused
  communities.
* If part of your culture is that you need to be thick skinned,
  that you need to be able to withstand abuse, then that *will*
  foster outreach to a particular demographic.
* And that's total assholes.

* I see a lot of places that are hostile to newcomers (RTFM!)
* I've seen many projects that are hostile to their own users!

* Hiring from github example (if your culture has barriers, then
  hiring from that culture can reinforce them).

* Outreach discussion (Greta Christina, etc)
    * Safe spaces (conferences, etc)

* Start your community on the right foot.
* Encourage diversity from the get-go
* Put them in positions of power. Local ownership.
