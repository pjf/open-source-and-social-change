* This is a talk about the future


* Mobile phone penetration
    * 
    * Wikipedia Zero?
    * Increase in violence?
    * No true internet access
    * New apps from Kenya
    * ASK THE USERS WHAT THEY NEED MOST

* Moving beyond open source
    * Building things for people like you
    * AWESOME!
    * The most good can be done by building things for those who
      are marginalised
    * (Can use Africa as an example)

* Making the world better
    * Disease
    * Poverty
    * Hospital software (citation)
    * Peak child?

* National Security and Population Growth
    * "It recommends that US leadership "influence national leaders" and that "improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the U.N., USIA, and USAID."

* Ethics
    * Neuroethics
        * More easily disgusted -> more conservative
        * But ethics are relative to society in which they were raised.
        * We need to *fix society*

* Open Source Resiliance
    * StepMania was a DDR clone
    * Konami sued, and won
    * But it had to remain open source, so nothing changed

* Diversity of governance
    * If you have a homogenous group put together a society, it will
      be friendly to *them*.
    * No intentional barriers to outsiders
    * But the culture *will* have barriers to entry
        * Language or geographical barriers.
        * Barriers to safety (eg, insisting on open conversations)
        * Ableist barriers (eg, stairs)
        * Gender barriers (eg, gendered toilets)
    * Must engage diversity in governance
    * You can't really decide for other groups what would be good
      for them.

* Need to get culture right *from the beginning*
    * Code of Conduct
    * Dispute resolution
    * etc
