* Intro
    * I am excited about the future
    * I thought the future was about flying cars
    * But really it's about this
        * Mobile phones
        * More people have access to mobile phones than clean drinking water
    * The future will be great, because we are doing so well in the present
    * 2014 was the best year in human history
        * Fewer people in poverty
        * Fewer wars
        * Less crime
        * etc etc
    * But there's an enormous problem
        * More people have access to mobile phones than drinking water
        * Some people don't have access to clean water
        * That is something *everyone* should have
    * In fact, some people don't have access to very basic needs at all
    * I would hope you'd want to help them based upon a caring of
      human life (wording?)
    * And I assure you, these are solveable problems, and we're
      absolutely making a difference.
    * If you're not sure where to start, givewell.org analyses
      humanitarian charities on the most good per dollar received.
      They do amazing work.
    * Giving what we can is a broader effort I can also recommend.
    * But if that's not an immediately compelling reason, I have
      this.
    * N billion people in extreme poverty
    * N billion people who, in their current state, will never have the
      opportunity to (cool thing here)
    * Sure, most of them will do nothing than look at pictures of cats
      on the internet
    * But *some* of them will go on to do amazing things.
    * We will see at least a N% increase in awesomeness worldwide
    * I will get my flying car N% sooner

    * Some of you may cry concerns about overpopulation
    * But improved health care and education always *reduces* birth rates
      (Graphic)
    * If you care about population pressure long term, and I care *very*
      much about the long-term future of humanity, then the *best* thing
      you can do is encourage humanitarian efforts
    * Especially the education and empowerment of women



* Brains
    * Ask people to talk about when they were awful to someone
    * Ask people to talk about when they intereacted with someone
    * Let them use liquid soap and water afterwards
    * OMG, they use more soap!
    * "Lady Macbeth effect"
    * We consistently see contemplation of unethical thoughts associated
      with disease-avoidance behaviours
    * This is a clue to how our brains work.

    * Show people disgusting images
        * Disgusting image for coders (poor indentation, etc)
    * Part of their brain lights up
    * Get them to think about unethical things
    * The *same* part of their brain lights up
    * This predicts their attitudes towards gay marraige(!)

    * It makes sense that our default ethics are optimised for ancestral
      reproductive success.
    * That's not a good foundation for ethics.

    * While orientation may depend upon neurological factors,
      they're always done *relative* to the society in which
      the person is raised.

    * So I'm going to focus on improving our culture.

* Ethics
    * Neuroethics
        * Brain region hijacked for morality ('disgusting', 'feel sick')
        * More easily disgusted -> more conservative
        * But ethics are relative to society in which they were raised.
        * We need to *fix society*
    * Example
        * In the middle ages, an assertive, opinionated woman had a special label.
        * They were a witch
        * Now, we call them a *PERSON*.

* I want to make the world a better place
    * Eliminate disease
    * Eliminate poverty
    * Mention WHY?
        * Less suffering, obviously that's good
        * Less population pressure. Yes, srsly!
        * Less disease (drinking water etc solves this)

* MARGINALISED PEOPLE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE TO HELP

* There is a reason why people are marginalised
    * Culture and institutions *keep* them that way
    * Without thinking

* Improving culture
    * Take from Skud's notes
    * User Groups / Conferences
        * These don't exist in truly toxic communities
        * "It's okay!"

* Ushahidi
    * Developed in Kenya after civil breakdown after $YEAR elections
    * Heavy involvement from communities where it's deployed
    * Local ownership and involvement
    * (Example from Afghanistan)
    * Wells set up
    * Wells would have problems, but not be reported or repaired
    * Low literacy
    * Technology - mobile phone
        * Voice interactive system
        * Is the well operational?
        * Can someone local repair it?
    * Bystander effect (someone else will report the well broken)
    * Paired with local phone company.
        * Not just a free call
        * Calling provides *bonus minutes*
    * Better verification of problems
    * *MUCH* faster response times on well repairs
    * Huge reduction in costs for well inspections (get figure?)

* Play Pump
    *
    * Need to pump the water into a tower, even if that tower is empty
    * Exhausting to children, etc.
    * Cannot be maintained by local community
    * Expensive! Four regular pumps could be installed for same price
    * Slow! Doesn't pump water as fast as a regular pump
    * In some cases existing pumps were *removed* to install a PP.
    * Absolutely failed at local community ownership

* Message
    * -> You need community *ownership*
    * Especially when it comes to diversity
    * You need to build a good community from the start
        * Engagement in diverse groups
        * Stakeholders and feedback
        * Outreach

* This is a talk about the future
    * Lots of people live there.
    * I already live there (Australia, GMT+10)
    * If we can make changes now that affect the *rest of human history*
      then that's a big deal!

* Segue into phones
    * I used to think the future was about flying cars
        * Show many flying cars pictures
    * But the most future thing we have is *this* (phone)
    * More people have mobile phones than access to safe drinking water (or electricity)
        * http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-putting-global-mobile-in-context-2012-4

* Mobile phone penetration
    * Wikipedia Zero?
    * Increase in violence?
    * No true internet access
    * New apps from Kenya
    * ASK THE USERS WHAT THEY NEED MOST

* Moving beyond open source
    * Building things for people like you
    * AWESOME!
    * The most good can be done by building things for those who
      are marginalised
    * (Can use Africa as an example)

* Making the world better
    * Disease
    * Poverty
    * Hospital software (citation)
    * Peak child?

* National Security and Population Growth
    * "It recommends that US leadership "influence national leaders" and that "improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the U.N., USIA, and USAID."

* Open Source Resiliance
    * StepMania was a DDR clone
    * Konami sued, and won
    * But it had to remain open source, so nothing changed

* Diversity of governance
    * If you have a homogenous group put together a society, it will
      be friendly to *them*.
    * No intentional barriers to outsiders
    * But the culture *will* have barriers to entry
        * Language or geographical barriers.
        * Barriers to safety (eg, insisting on open conversations)
        * Ableist barriers (eg, stairs)
        * Gender barriers (eg, gendered toilets)
    * Must engage diversity in governance
    * You can't really decide for other groups what would be good
      for them.

* Need to get culture right *from the beginning*
    * Code of Conduct
    * Dispute resolution
    * etc

* DreamWidth as a model society
* Loomio as a facilitation tool
